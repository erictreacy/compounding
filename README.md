# Eric's Lab Notes

Welcome to the Prescription Compounding Lab Home page. Here you will find most things that I currently use in my lab: vendors, SOPs \(need Dropbox access\), references, links, and more. 

This page runs on GitBook. All updates \(gits\) and changes are found on GitHub. Feel free to make a pull request to edit on GitHub if you please.
